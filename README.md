# ML-increase Walmart sales
This is a ML project where I have analysed WALMART's data and found ways to increase their sales

Here, in this repository I have not just shown the code but also shared the presentation of the ways we (me and my teammate) analysed the data and found out ways to increase their sales

The code has been done on Python and we used Jupter Notebook for writing the code.
Several packages have been used for the plotting and analysis of the dataset provided.

I have also attached the dataset which is a csv file in the repo.
